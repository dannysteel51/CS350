# CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

We were to create an interface that allows the user to control hardware components on the TI Board. We had to take advantage of certain peripherals, such as I2C, GPIO, and UART, to accomplish this. Using these tools, utilizing STATES in the code, we had the board display a reading of the room's temperature to the console. And with the use of the buttons on the board, with the help of the STATES, we were able to increase or decrease the temp, which was also displayed in the console. This project was to show how a standard thermostat in a house would work. 

What did you do particularly well?

Of all the things I feel I did well, creating and utilizing the STATES comes to mind. Since I've been working in Unreal Engine for a few years now, I was well-versed in ENUMs, which is the equivalent of the STATES used in this course.

Where could you improve?

I can stand to improve on many things, but I think the one thing I lack is trusting myself and working through the code before going and looking for tutorials or using sites such as StackOverflow. I know if I just did it, I could parse out working code on my own, with all I've learned so far, but it's also very easy to google any question that comes to mind.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Since I am very focused on building better skills specifically for Game Development, I think this course prepared me in many ways. For starters, working with an embedded system is similar to working with a game engine. In game development, I create code that will be implemented in the engine on an actor that will perform some action on the screen. This is very similar to coding a program that will perform some action on a piece of hardware. The parallels are many, and because of that, I think this course has only solidified some skills I was already working on.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By utilizing comments, proper use of whitespace, and making code reusable, I think I was able to create a well-written and powerful program.
